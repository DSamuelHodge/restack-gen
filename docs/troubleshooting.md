# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

## CLI not found after install

Symptoms:
- `restack: command not found` or `'restack' is not recognized as an internal or external command`

Fixes:
- Activate your virtual environment:
  - Windows (PowerShell): `. .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`
  - macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Ensure Python Scripts are on PATH. Re-open your terminal after installation.
- Verify install location: `python -m pip show restack-gen`

## Python version error

Symptoms:
- Installation blocked or runtime errors about version mismatch

Fixes:
- Use Python 3.11+.
  - Windows: `py -3.11` to select interpreter
  - macOS/Linux: `python3.11`

## `service.py not found`

Symptoms:
- Running `restack run:server` fails with an error like `service.py not found`

Fixes:
- Run from the project root created by `restack new <app>`.
- Ensure `server/service.py` exists (generated by the scaffold).

## `.env` not applied

Symptoms:
- Environment variables don't seem to take effect when running the server

Fixes:
- Ensure a file named `.env` exists at the project root.
- Each line should be `KEY=VALUE`; comments and blank lines are ignored.
- Variables in the shell take precedence over `.env` values.

## Engine connectivity errors

Symptoms:
- Doctor or runtime complains about reaching the Restack engine

Fixes:
- The server runs offline by default; connectivity is optional for local development.
- If using an engine, verify `RESTACK_ENGINE_URL` and firewall/network settings.

## Permission or git status warnings (doctor)

Symptoms:
- `restack doctor` prints warnings about permissions or uncommitted changes

Fixes:
- Fix file permissions (ensure your user can write to project directories).
- Commit or stash changes to keep your working tree clean.

## Windows PATH messages during build tools install

Symptoms:
- Installing build tools prints PATH warnings for scripts

Fixes:
- Usually harmless for end users of the CLI. For development, ensure your Python Scripts folder is on PATH or use the venv Scripts directory.

## Still stuck?

- Run `restack doctor` and address reported issues.
- Open an issue with the exact command, OS, Python version, and full traceback/output.
