# PR 7: Pipeline integration & examples â€” Completion Summary

Date: 2025-10-24

## Scope Delivered
- Implemented two end-to-end examples in `examples/`:
	- `data_pipeline`: sequential data processing
	- `email_pipeline`: parallel checks with conditional routing
- Added `restack_gen/validator.py` providing:
	- Cycle detection and unreachable node detection
	- Execution order and dependency graph mapping
	- Graph metrics (total resources, max depth, parallel sections, conditional branches)
- Authored `docs/PIPELINES.md` covering operator syntax, generation, validation, patterns, and troubleshooting.

## Key Artifacts
- `examples/data_pipeline/` and `examples/email_pipeline/` (workflows, clients, tests)
- `restack_gen/validator.py` with comprehensive traversal and checks
- `tests/test_validator.py` (29 tests) covering cycles, reachability, ordering, dependencies, metrics
- `docs/PIPELINES.md` end-to-end guide

## Verification
- Targeted validator tests: 29 passed
- Full project test suite: 215 passed
- Coverage: 80.44% total; `validator.py` ~84.91%

## Notes
- Aligned validator with IR API (Sequence.nodes, Parallel.nodes, Conditional.condition is a string; optional false_branch).
- Updated documentation and examples to reflect final behavior.
