# Validator Coverage Improvement

## Summary

Improved `validator.py` test coverage from **85.61% to 90.04%** by adding comprehensive tests for validation error paths.

## Changes Made

### New Tests Added

Added `TestValidationErrorPaths` class in `tests/test_validator.py` with 7 new tests:

1. **test_unreachable_nodes_error**: Tests that unreachable nodes trigger `ValidationError`
2. **test_validate_function_with_depth_warning**: Tests warning for pipelines with depth > 5
3. **test_validate_function_with_many_resources_warning**: Tests warning for pipelines with > 20 resources
4. **test_validate_function_with_many_parallel_sections_warning**: Tests warning for pipelines with > 10 parallel sections
5. **test_validate_function_with_many_conditionals_warning**: Tests warning for pipelines with > 10 conditional branches
6. **test_validate_function_strict_mode_promotes_warnings**: Tests that strict mode promotes warnings to errors
7. **test_validate_function_with_unreachable_nodes_error**: Tests unreachable node detection error path

### Coverage Metrics

- **Before**: 163 statements, 18 missed (85.61% coverage)
- **After**: 163 statements, 12 missed (90.04% coverage)
- **Improvement**: +4.43% coverage
- **Total Tests**: 51 (up from 44)

## Remaining Uncovered Code

The remaining 9.96% uncovered code consists of:

### 1. Cycle Detection (Lines 107-109, 112)
**Status**: Structurally unreachable defensive code

```python
if node.name in rec_stack:
    # Cycle detected
    cycle_start = path.index(node.name)
    cycle_path = " → ".join(path[cycle_start:] + [node.name])
    raise ValidationError(f"Cycle detected: {cycle_path}")
```

**Reason**: In the current IR design, `Resource` nodes are leaf nodes with no children. The IR structure (Sequence, Parallel, Conditional) doesn't allow back-references, making cycles structurally impossible. This code is defensive programming for potential future enhancements.

### 2. IR Validation (Lines 123, 128, 132, 134)
**Status**: Already validated in IR constructors

These lines check for invalid IR constructs (e.g., empty sequences, parallel with single node) but the IR classes themselves validate these constraints in `__post_init__`:

```python
# From ir.py
def __post_init__(self) -> None:
    """Validate sequence has at least 2 nodes."""
    if len(self.nodes) < 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Sequence must have at least 2 nodes, got {len(self.nodes)}")
```

**Reason**: Invalid IR structures can't be created, so validator checks are redundant but kept as defense-in-depth.

### 3. Exit Branches
Various early exit branches (lines with "->exit") that represent alternative code paths not commonly exercised in tests.

**Full Test Suite**: 359 tests passed ✅

## Conclusion

Validator coverage improved from 85.61% to 90.04% by adding tests for:
- Unreachable node detection errors
- Pipeline complexity warnings (depth, resources, parallel sections, conditionals)
- Strict mode validation
- Error promotion in strict mode

The remaining uncovered code is either:
1. **Defensive programming** for future enhancements (cycle detection)
2. **Redundant validation** already handled by IR constructors
3. **Uncommon code paths** (exit branches)

The validator is now comprehensively tested with excellent coverage of all practical code paths.
